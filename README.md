VirtualMachine
==============
STEP 3: This is a simple virtual machine, simulating a hypothetical microprocessor. It also contains a simple test
language that compiles to the virtual machine's bytecode. The virtual machine is hosted on an interactive website,
using Flask and Redis.

Built for Python 2.7.

Pre-requisites (pip): enum34, antlr4-python2-runtime, redis and Flask.
